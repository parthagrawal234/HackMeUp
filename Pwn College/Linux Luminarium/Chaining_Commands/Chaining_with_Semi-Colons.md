# Chaining with Semi Colons
This challenge asks to chain `/challenge/pwn` and `/challenge/college` together to get the flag
```bash
hacker@chaining~chaining-with-semicolons:~$ /challenge/pwn;/challenge/college
Yes! You chained /challenge/pwn and /challenge/college! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{MeQ1A2UzrsI15O34mTrW4P9XSSp.dVTN4QDLzQjN1czW}
hacker@chaining~chaining-with-semicolons:~$
```
I used `;` to chain both of them togther to get the flag
