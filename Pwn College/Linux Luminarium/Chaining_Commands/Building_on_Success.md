# Building on Success
In this challenge, you need to chain the programs /challenge/first-success and /challenge/second using the && operator.

```bash
Connected!
hacker@chaining~building-on-success:~$ /challenge/first-success
hacker@chaining~building-on-success:~$ /challenge/second
Error: /challenge/first-success must be successfully chained with
/challenge/second using &&
hacker@chaining~building-on-success:~$ /challenge/first-success && /challenge/second
Nice chaining! Flag: pwn.college{coeCpGp5wX5XWROkddb3R7FrFRn.QXyQzM4EDLzQjN1czW}
