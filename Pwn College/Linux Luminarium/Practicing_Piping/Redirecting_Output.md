This challenge asks us to use input redirection to write `PWN` to `COLLEGE` file
```bash
Connected!
hacker@piping~redirecting-output:~$ echo PWN > COLLEGE
Correct! You successfully redirected 'PWN' to the file 'COLLEGE'! Here is your
flag:
pwn.college{E9XcoaM-iyQGxfIabfnUTTN6Trz.dRjN1QDLzQjN1czW}
hacker@piping~redirecting-output:~$
```
I used `>` command to redirect output of `echo PWN` to `COLLEGE` file using the command `echo PWN > COLLEGE`
