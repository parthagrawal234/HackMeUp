# Tab Completion

This challenge has copied the flag into /challenge/pwncollege, and you can freely cat that file. But you can't type the filename: we used some serious trickery to make sure that you must tab-complete it.

```bash
                                                                      Connected!
hacker@globbing~tab-completion:~$ cat /challenge/pwncollegeâ€‹
pwn.college{QxjKP59C-zhiujyRtx1nIJ6KBBr.QX0QTM3EDLzQjN1czW}
hacker@globbing~tab-completion:~$
```

## Solution
I tabbed after typing /challenge/pwn and it autocompleted the file to /challenge/pwncollege and i got the flag
