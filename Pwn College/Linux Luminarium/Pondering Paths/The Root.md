# The Root
In this level, we've added a program right in /, called pwn, that will give you the flag. All you need to do for this level is to invoke this program!

```bash
Connected!
hacker@paths~the-root:~$ /pwn
BOOM!!!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{08YfBAVXeWZLYde35P-B_OzQYSd.dhzN5QDLzQjN1czW}
hacker@paths~the-root:~$
```

Learned Lessons- I learned about / being root and absolute paths
