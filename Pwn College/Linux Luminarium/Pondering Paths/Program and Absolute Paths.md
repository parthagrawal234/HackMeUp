# Program and Absolute Paths

This challenge again requires you to execute it by invoking its absolute path. You'll want to execute the run file that is in the challenge directory that is, in turn, in the / directory. If you invoke the challenge correctly, it will give you the flag. Good luck!

## Solve
Flag - pwn.college{4YoEkq8UFuR_JrLMjBEm9fBr1LE.dVDN1QDLzQjN1czW}

```bash
Connected!
hacker@paths~program-and-absolute-paths:~$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{4YoEkq8UFuR_JrLMjBEm9fBr1LE.dVDN1QDLzQjN1czW}
hacker@paths~program-and-absolute-paths:~$
```
