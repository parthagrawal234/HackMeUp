# Handling Failure
In this challenge, you need to chain /challenge/first-failure and /challenge/second using the || operator. Go for it!

```bash
Connected!
hacker@chaining~handling-failure:~$ /challenge/first-failure || /challenge/second
Nice chaining! Flag: pwn.college{4jZRe4moEpN7M6PXPbRLjr3tgBd.QXzQzM4EDLzQjN1czW}
hacker@chaining~handling-failure:~$
```

I made the second command work only if the first one fails
