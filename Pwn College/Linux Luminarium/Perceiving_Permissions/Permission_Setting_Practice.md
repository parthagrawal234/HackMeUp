# Permission Setting Practice
This asks us to change the persmission of `/challenge/pwn` using `chmod` with `=` arguments 8 times in a row to control `/flag` permission and get the flag
```bash
Connected!
hacker@permissions~permissions-setting-practice:~$ chmod /challenge/pwn
/usr/bin/chmod: missing operand after ‘/challenge/pwn’
Try '/usr/bin/chmod --help' for more information.
NEEDED, BUT UNMET permissions of "/challenge/pwn": --xrwx---
- the user doesn't have read permissions
- the user doesn't have write permissions
* the user does have execute permissions
* the group does have read permissions
* the group does have write permissions
* the group does have execute permissions
- the world doesn't have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions

* the group does have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions

You set the correct permissions!
You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

Current permissions of "/flag": ---------
- the user doesn't have read permissions
- the user doesn't have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
- the world doesn't have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions
hacker@permissions~permissions-setting-practice:~$ chmod u+r /flag
hacker@permissions~permissions-setting-practice:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{g5C2A0qEud8k3OesoWlD9Bs0ExQ.dNTM5QDLzQjN1czW}
hacker@permissions~permissions-setting-practice:~$
```
I used `chmod` to change permissions and `cat /flag` to get the flag
