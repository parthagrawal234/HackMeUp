# Permission Tweaking Practice
This challenge asks us to change the permission of `/challenge/pwn` correctly 8 times in a row to gain the ability to change permissions of `/flag` to get the flag
```bash
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ chmod o+w /challenge/pwn

You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

Current permissions of "/flag": ---------
- the user doesn't have read permissions
- the user doesn't have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
- the world doesn't have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ ls -l /flag
---------- 1 hacker hacker 58 Oct 19 10:14 /flag
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ chmod o+r /flag
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ cat /flag
cat: /flag: Permission denied
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ chmod u+r /flag
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{wtvsW7mCUHr3VPuQyS3rd3Xbfiq.dBTM2QDLzQjN1czW}
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$
```
I used `chmod` to change all the permission and then `cat /flag` to get the flag
