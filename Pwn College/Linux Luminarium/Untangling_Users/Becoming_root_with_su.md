# Becoming Root with su
This challenge asks to become root user using `su` to get the flag
```bash
Connected!
hacker@users~becoming-root-with-su:~$ su
Password:
root@users~becoming-root-with-su:/home/hacker# cat /flag
pwn.college{oARnwaIkhU59L2U7OlkjzEmj2RV.dVTN0UDLzQjN1czW}
root@users~becoming-root-with-su:/home/hacker#

I used `su` command and then gave password `hack-the-planet` to get the flag
