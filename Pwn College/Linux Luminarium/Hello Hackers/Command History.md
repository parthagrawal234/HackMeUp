# Command History

This challenge will inject the flag into your history. Bring up a terminal, hit the up arrow, and grab it! In other challenges, the history will contain the log of the commands you've run, so if you need to run a similar command again, you can use the arrow keys to scroll through and find it!

```bash
hacker@hello~command-history:~$ the flag is pwn.college{EQ-6Iz4Hujt4oE8WirR4wqwe2B0.QX2MTM3EDLzQjN1czW}
bash: the: command not found
hacker@hello~command-history:~$
```
